# Examples
Please note a lot of these examples are really test reports; they duplicate functionality of other reports but exposed a specific issue that was needed for me to figure out a bug.

The unique reports in this folder are:

Any reports not listed in this list are a duplicate in some way; but may show how to use certain extra functionality.

If you have any ideas for more reports that show off other functionality; please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/NathanaelA/fluentreports/issues).
